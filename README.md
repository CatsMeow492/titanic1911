In this project the goal is to correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck of May 31, 1911 using data science.  I will be primarily be using python with numpy, matplotlib, scikitlearn, pandas and seaborn (for style) in order to come up with useful insights into the variables that effected survival ultimately using regression to create a model to predict the probability of any particular passenger surviving.  

Insights:

1.) Counterintuitively; a majority of surivors were normally distributed at the 20-30 age range.
