# Project Planning

In this project the goal is to predict the likelihood of someone surviving the Titanic shipwreck of May 31, 1911. Using data from kaggle I will create various predictive models using machine learning and evaluate the effectiveness of the different models. The technologies I will work with will by python along with various math data science, graphing, and machine learning libraries. This will be achieved in <number of> steps.

- Data Cleaning: Since our data is likely incomplete we will have to normalise it by filling in values with the mean value of the set where possible and simply remove entries where it's not. Also, sex is stored as string values of either female or male. This may make it trickier to work with so we're actually going to create a new column where sex is represented by a boolean where 1 indicates male and 0 indicates female.
